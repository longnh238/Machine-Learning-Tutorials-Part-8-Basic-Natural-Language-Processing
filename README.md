# Machine Learning Tutorials - Part 8: Basic Natural Language Processing

Welcome to **Machine Learning Tutorials - Part 8: Basic Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. In this tutorial, we cover fundamental NLP techniques such as **Tokenization**, **POS Tagging**, **Stemming and Lemmatization**, **Stop Words Removal**, **N-Grams**, **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**, and **Sentiment Analysis**. Additionally, we explore how to model textual data using the **Bag of Words (BoW)** representation and train a classifier with **Multinomial Naive Bayes**.

## Introduction
In this part of the tutorial series, we dive into the basics of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** using Python's **NLTK** library and explore the following concepts:
- **Tokenization**: Breaking text into individual words or sentences.
- **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**: Assigning grammatical labels like nouns, verbs, adjectives to words.
- **Stemming and Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base or root forms.
- **Stop Words Removal**: Filtering out common words like "is", "and", "the" that do not carry much meaning.
- **N-Grams**: Creating sequences of words (unigrams, bigrams, trigrams).
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Extracting entities like people, organizations, and locations from text.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing the polarity of text (positive, negative, neutral).

The tutorial also covers how to model textual data using **Bag of Words (BoW)** and perform text classification using **Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)**.

## Installation
To run the tutorials, ensure you have Python and the following libraries installed.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Wordcloud and Matplotlib (optional for visualization)

## Tutorial Topics
1. **Tokenization**
   - Breaking text into words (word tokenization) and sentences (sentence tokenization)
   - Implementing tokenization using NLTK
2. **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**
   - Assigning grammatical roles to each word in a sentence (e.g., noun, verb)
   - POS tagging with NLTK
3. **Stemming and Lemmatization**
   - Reducing words to their base form using stemming and lemmatization techniques
   - Implementing stemming (PorterStemmer) and lemmatization (WordNetLemmatizer)
4. **Removing Stop Words**
   - Filtering out common stop words using NLTKâ€™s predefined stopword list
5. **N-Grams**
   - Creating unigrams, bigrams, trigrams from text data
   - Working with N-Grams in NLTK
6. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
   - Identifying entities like people, locations, organizations in text
   - Using NLTK to perform NER
7. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Analyzing the sentiment of text data (positive, negative, or neutral)
   - Implementing a basic sentiment analysis model
8. **Modeling Text Data (BoW and MultinomialNB)**
   - Converting text into numerical features using **Bag of Words (BoW)**
   - Implementing a **Multinomial Naive Bayes** classifier for text classification
